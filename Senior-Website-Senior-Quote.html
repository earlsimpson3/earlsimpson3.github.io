        <p>I really wanted to say more than just a senior quote. These past 12 years has been interesting. I have met different people, made enemies, and friends. I have achieved more than I thought I was capable of and was pushed to go even further. It truly has been a long time coming.</p>

		<p>First of all I would like to thank my friends. You guys are the best! When I need help or someone to talk, you were there. I wish the best for you. I would also like to thank my teachers. You have taught me not only what I can learn in school, but also in life. Thanks for always pushing me. Last, but not least, I thank my family for supporting me, helping balance school and work, and always helping me make life decisions. You have been helpful to me in more ways than you think.</p>

		<p>	Time moves really fast. I've had good memories of high school. I can't believe how we've all have grown up. We have come so far. I hope that you won't give up and go after that the things you want. I will miss everyone that I have met. Life is changing, but I hope we don't forget the special moments.</p>

		<p>For people who are graduating, I wanted to say Congratulations! We did it! I want you guys to know that from now on you can do what you want. Don’t give up and remember we can overcome any obstacle ahead of us. That’s what makes us strong.</p>
